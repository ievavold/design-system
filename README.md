# Design System

## Install Locally

1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing)
2. Install npm dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the local server with `npm start`
4. In the browser, open `http://localhost:1313`

Once the local Hugo server is running, any changes made on the local file system
will automatically rebuild the site and refresh the browser.

The Hugo server can be stopped in the terminal with `^C`
